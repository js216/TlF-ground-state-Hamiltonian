# TlF ground state Hamiltonian

This is the code to calculate the matrix elements of the TlF ground-state Hamiltonian. Please refer to the included Jupyter notebook for extensive comments on how it all works. Briefly, the code defines classes to represent quantum basis and superposition states, and uses basic quantum mechanics to evaluate matrix elements.
